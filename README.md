# Book-Search-Engine

## Description

This is a MERN stack application using the Google Books API and operates as a book search engine. Using the starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, it has now been refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. Apart from book searching, users have the ability to register and log in to their accounts in order to save their favorite books.
